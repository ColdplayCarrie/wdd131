            <h2>Mosiah 4:3</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and
                they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of
                conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according
                to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</p>

            <p>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
                And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou
                mine unbelief.</p>
