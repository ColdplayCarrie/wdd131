W04 Project: Website Subject

Project Subject: The Korean pop (Kpop) group, SHINee

Description of Planned Content: This website will center around the Kpop group, SHINee. It will include a brief description of Kpop on the first page. There will be a link to another page that will give the history of the group, and another link to a page that gives a brief biography of each member of the group (there are five). The page may include a countdown to the groupâ€™s next concert, next album release, or the closest birthday out of the group. It may also include a button that might allow the user to add their email address to a mailing list for updates on the group.

Reason: I wanted to do a website that was interesting and about something that I am familiar with to make the project more enjoyable.
